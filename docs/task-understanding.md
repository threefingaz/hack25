# Guide to Writing Task Understanding for AI Assistants

## Overview

Task understanding is a critical skill that ensures you correctly interpret what users actually need, not just what they initially ask for. This guide will help you develop clear, actionable task understanding that bridges the gap between what users say and what will truly solve their problems.

## Core Principles

### 1. Surface Requests Often Hide Deeper Needs

Users frequently express their needs in terms of solutions they've already imagined, rather than the actual problems they're trying to solve. For example:
- **User says:** "Make the phone number bigger on the website"
- **They actually want:** More people to call them
- **Better solution might be:** Explain why customers should call, improving the value proposition

### 2. Distinguish Between Implementation Language and Business Language

There are two types of language in any request:
- **Implementation/Technical Language:** "Add a banner," "Change the color," "Make it modern"
- **Business/Goal Language:** "Increase sales," "Reduce support tickets," "Attract younger customers"

Always dig deeper to uncover the business language behind technical requests.

### 3. Ask "Stupid" Questions

Don't be afraid to ask seemingly obvious questions. Explicitly tell users: "I'm going to ask some questions that might seem basic, but they help me understand your needs better." This gives you permission to explore thoroughly.

## The Task Understanding Process

### Step 1: Initial Exploration

When a user presents a request, begin with open-ended questions:
- "What are you trying to achieve?"
- "Why is this important now?"
- "What problem does this solve?"
- "How will you measure success?"
- "What happens if we don't do this?"

### Step 2: Context Gathering

Understand the broader situation:
- What's already been tried?
- What constraints exist (time, budget, technical)?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What's the history of this problem?
- Are there examples of similar solutions that worked/failed?

### Step 3: Reframe in Business Terms

Transform technical requests into business goals:
- **Original:** "We need a chatbot on our website"
- **Reframed:** "We need to reduce response time for customer inquiries to improve satisfaction and reduce support costs"

### Step 4: Propose Solution Models

Once you understand the real need, propose solutions using this formula:

**"To achieve [business goal], by [specific implementation]"**

Examples:
- "To increase course enrollments by 20%, by simplifying the registration process and adding clearer value propositions"
- "To reduce support tickets about password resets, by implementing a self-service password recovery system"

### Step 5: Document Understanding

Write a clear task understanding that includes:

1. **Business Objective:** What success looks like in measurable terms
2. **Context:** Background, constraints, and previous attempts
3. **Proposed Solution:** Specific approach with reasoning
4. **Success Metrics:** How we'll measure achievement
5. **Scope Boundaries:** What's included and explicitly what's not
6. **Next Steps:** Clear action items and timeline

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Accepting Technical Solutions at Face Value
When someone says "just add a popup," always ask why. The popup might be their imagined solution to a problem that could be better solved differently.

### 2. Skipping the Understanding Phase
It's tempting to jump straight to implementation, especially for "simple" requests. Resist this. Even a 5-minute understanding conversation can prevent hours of rework.

### 3. Making Assumptions
Don't assume you know what terms mean to the user. Their "modern design" might mean something completely different from your interpretation.

### 4. Scope Creep Through "While We're At It"
When users say "while we're at it, let's also fix X," treat this as a new task requiring its own understanding process. Mixing tasks leads to confused priorities and failed projects.

### 5. Not Documenting the Understanding
Verbal agreements are forgotten or remembered differently. Always write down the task understanding and get confirmation.

## Example Task Understanding Document

**Task:** Help users find banking services

**Understanding:**
- **Business Objective:** Increase the number of qualified leads for our premium banking accounts by 30% within Q2
- **Context:** Current website visitors can't easily compare account types. Support reports 40% of calls are about account features. Competitors have interactive comparison tools.
- **Proposed Solution:** Create an interactive account comparison tool that helps users identify the best account for their needs based on their banking habits, leading them to apply online
- **Success Metrics:** 
  - 30% increase in premium account applications
  - 50% reduction in support calls about account features
  - 80% of tool users complete the comparison process
- **Out of Scope:** Changes to the actual account features, modifications to the application process
- **Next Steps:** 
  1. Review 3 competitor comparison tools
  2. Interview 5 recent account openers about their decision process
  3. Create wireframes for review

## Key Phrases for Task Understanding

Use these phrases to guide conversations:
- "Help me understand what you're trying to achieve..."
- "What would success look like to you?"
- "Tell me more about why this is important..."
- "What have you already tried?"
- "If we solve this perfectly, what changes?"
- "Let me make sure I understand correctly..."

## Remember

Task understanding is not about being difficult or slowing things down. It's about ensuring that the time and effort invested produces real value. A well-understood task completed successfully is worth more than ten misunderstood tasks that miss the mark.

When in doubt, ask another question. The cost of misunderstanding far exceeds the cost of taking a few extra minutes to get clarity.
