## 🚀 How to Resume Development

### Prerequisites Check
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/alnikitin/Code/hack25

# Check Node.js version (should be recent)
node --version

# Verify dependencies are installed
npm list --depth=0
cd client && npm list --depth=0
```

### Start Development Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend server
npm run dev
