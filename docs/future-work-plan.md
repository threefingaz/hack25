## 1. Cash Flow Optimization Tips (Priority: HIGH)
**Status**: Planned, not started

### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] Create `/utils/cashFlowTipsEngine.js` with tip generation logic
- [ ] Create `/data/tipTemplates.js` with all tip content
- [ ] Build flexible component structure:
  - [ ] `/components/tips/CashFlowTips.js` (container)
  - [ ] `/components/tips/TipsList.js` (layout wrapper)
  - [ ] `/components/tips/TipItem.js` (individual tip)
  - [ ] `/components/tips/styles/index.js` (all styles)
- [ ] Add tips to CashFlowAnalysisPage
- [ ] Add tips to SuccessDashboardPage
- [ ] Create persona-specific tip sets
- [ ] Test with all personas (Anna, Mehmet, Maria, Thomas, Stefan)

### Design Flexibility Requirements:
- Keep all visual styles in single file
- Support multiple layout variants (default, compact, cards, minimal)

## Notes for Next Session

1. **Start with**: Cash Flow Tips implementation
2. **Remember**: Design flexibility is crucial
3. **Test with**: All 5 personas (including rejection flows)
4. **Keep**: Clean code separation between logic and UI
5. **Branch from**: `feature/weekly-microcredit`

## Questions to Address Next Time

1. Should tips be dismissible/hideable?
2. How many tips to show at once?
3. Should tips update dynamically as cash flow changes?
4. Do we need tip categories/filtering?
5. Should rejected users see different tips?
